# Markdown Previewer

This project is a simple markdown previewer that allows users to enter GitHub flavored markdown in a textarea, and it renders the formatted HTML output in real-time.

## Project Description

This markdown previewer fulfills the following user stories:

- **User Story #1**: There is a textarea element with the ID "editor".
- **User Story #2**: There is an element with the ID "preview".
- **User Story #3**: When text is entered into the "editor" textarea, the "preview" element is updated in real-time to display the content of the textarea.
- **User Story #4**: When GitHub flavored markdown is entered into the "editor" textarea, the text is rendered as HTML in the "preview" element as the user types. The Marked library is used for this purpose.
- **User Story #5**: When the markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the "editor" textarea contains valid markdown representing at least one of each of the following elements: a heading element (H1 size), a subheading element (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.
- **User Story #6**: When the markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the "editor" textarea is rendered as HTML in the "preview" element.
